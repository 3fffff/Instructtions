One new feature in the 2.6.13-rc3 kernel release, 
is the ability to bind and unbind drivers from devices manually from user space. 
Previously, the only way to disconnect a driver from a device was usually to unload the whole driver from memory, using rmmod.
/sys/bus/usb/drivers/ch341
echo "5-1.1:1.0" > unbind
