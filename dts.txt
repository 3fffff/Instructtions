I'd suggest using devtool modify linux-at91 to modify the linux kernel source-tree. This will create a linux-at91 folder in your ${TOPDIR}/workspace/sources/linux-at91. If you don't know your ${TOPDIR}, try to use bitbake -e <recipe-name> | grep "TOPDIR". bitbake -e will print your entire metadata for that recipe, here you can use grep to find the assignments of different variables. (like your KERNEL_DEVICETREE)

    ${TOPDIR}/workspace/sources/linux-at91

This will be the source tree for your linux-at91 recipe.

Copy your dts files into ${TOPDIR}/workspace/sources/linux-at91/arch/arm/boot/dts.

Modify the Makefile to include your dts, as pointed out by @BelHadjSalem TALEL (Thanks!).

Commit these changes and generate a patch.

In your own layer, under recipes-kernel/linux-at91/linux-at91 place this patch file. Add recipes-kernel/linux-at91/linux-at91.bbappend to include this patch as below:

FILESEXTRAPATHS_prepend := "${THISDIR}/${PN}:"
SRC_URI += "file://0001-add-dts-file.patch"

Now to build your custom-machine, add conf/machine/custom-machine.conf and add an entry for your custom KERNEL_DEVICETREE like shown here

# This will inherit your base machine
require conf/machine/sama5d27-wlsom1-ek-sd.conf

KERNEL_DEVICETREE = "your-dts-file.dtb"

Overall, your layer will have following files:

- conf/layer.conf
- conf/machine/custom-machine.conf (Contains the above settings)
- recipes-kernel/linux-at91/linux-at91/0001-add-dts-file.patch
- recipes-kernel/linux-at91/linux-at91/linux-at91.bbappend
